## üìù Steps / Solution

1. **Find the open ports of machine using Nmap**

I ran an Nmap full-port service/version scan to discover open TCP ports and services:

```bash
nmap -T4 -p- -sV -vv 10.10.122.238
```

- `-p-` scans all 65535 TCP ports  
- `-sV` attempts service/version detection  
- `-T4` is aggressive but safer than `-T5` on target networks (avoid `-T5` on production/public infra)

**Sample output:**
```text
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 8.2p1
80/tcp   open  http       Apache httpd 2.4.41
```
ports 22 & 80 are open!
